# Bookstore Analytics

Welcome to the Bookstore Analytics project repository! This project highlights my expertise in developing interactive Tableau dashboards, proficient usage of Alteryx for data cleaning and preparation, deriving insights, and presenting them to stakeholders through beautifully designed dashboards. 

**Due to the nature and size of the dataset, please note that this project was not hosted on Tableau Public but can be accessed and explored locally using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader.**

Below are the key highlights of this project:

## Overview:
- Developed 12 dashboards using Tableau Desktop for a Bookstore dataset, categorized into 4 sets (A, B, C for each category) along with storyboards for each dashboard.
- Leveraged Alteryx Desktop for efficient data cleaning and preparation, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the underlying data.
- Used Figma to design components and background layout for Tableau dashboards, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

## Salient Features:
- **Tableau Dashboard Expertise:** Created visually appealing and interactive dashboards tailored to specific stakeholder needs, enhancing decision-making capabilities.
- **Alteryx Data Preparation:** Utilized Alteryx to streamline data cleaning and preparation processes, optimizing data quality and integrity for analysis.
- **Insightful Analysis:** Derived actionable insights from the dataset, utilizing statistical techniques to uncover patterns and trends critical for business decision-making.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Presented insights effectively through beautifully designed dashboards, enabling stakeholders to grasp complex information at a glance.

## Statistical Inferences:
- **Significance Testing:** Utilized statistical tests (e.g., P-value) to determine the significance of relationships between variables, such as Number of Checkouts and Checkout Month.
- **R-squared Analysis:** Interpreted R-squared values to gauge the strength of relationships between variables, providing insights into factors influencing business outcomes.
- **Cluster Classigication:** 
  The cluster classification of Books by Ratings vs Sales reveals distinct patterns in the relationship between book ratings and sales performance. Books are categorized into clusters based on their ratings and sales volume, ranging from low-rated books with low sales to highly rated books driving high sales. This analysis provides valuable insights for decision-making, highlighting the varying impact of ratings on sales across different segments. For stakeholders in the publishing industry, these statistical inferences offer strategic guidance for optimizing marketing efforts, inventory management, and content development to maximize sales potential and reader satisfaction.

## Stakeholders:
The four stakeholders that were identified - Sales & Marketing Team, Editorial Team, Authors and Library.
- **Sales & Marketing Dashboard:** Provides insights into the bookshop's sales across different categories, aiding Sales & Marketing teams in revenue generation strategies.
- **Author Overview Dashboard:** Offers deep insights into author performance and impact, enabling stakeholders to explore each author's contribution.
- **Book Ratings & Reviews Dashboard:** Analyzes book ratings and reviews, helping Editorial Teams understand reader satisfaction levels.
- **Checkout Trends Dashboard:** Examines transactional data to understand customer behavior and optimize inventory management.

## Approach:
